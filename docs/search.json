The interdisciplinary AI Committee members will first undergo extensive training in ethical and effective AI use. Subsequently, this committee will:\n\nFacilitate broader staff training\n\nCreate clear onboarding procedures for new hires\n\nConduct ongoing peer observation and co-teaching\n\nFoster school-wide understanding of AI’s ethical implications (Furze 2024)\n\n\n\nGuardrails\nGuardrails will be articulated as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), ensuring ethical AI integration aligns with institutional commitments to sustainability, diversity, inclusion, academic integrity, and transparency (UWC Costa Rica 2022). These SOPs will explicitly outline acceptable AI uses, proper citation practices, and protocols addressing equity, bias mitigation, and privacy."
