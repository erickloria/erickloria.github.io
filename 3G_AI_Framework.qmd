## Framework Selected

This policy is developed in alignment with three key guiding frameworks:

- **UWC Costa Rica Strategic Plan (2022–2027)**, which emphasizes sustainability, innovation, personalized and experiential learning, and community engagement [@uwc2022].
- **National Artificial Intelligence Strategy of Costa Rica (MICITT, 2024–2027)**, which underscores ethical AI use, human rights, and equity [@micitt2024].
- **Green Schools National Network (GSNN) Framework**, particularly in cultivating holistic and experiential learning, promoting wellbeing, and integrating efficient systems [@gsnn2024].

## Key Priorities 

- **Sustainability**
- **Personalized and Experiential Learning**
- **Academic Excellence and Future-Readiness**
- **Belonging and Community Well-being**
- **Global Citizenship**

## AI Integration (3G AI Framework)

### Governance

AI governance at UWC Costa Rica is structured as a comprehensive, school-wide initiative. Governance includes an interdisciplinary AI Committee comprising representatives from:

- Academic Leadership Team  
- Human Resources  
- Co-curricular Department  
- Administration  
- Student and Community Voices  

This committee oversees implementation, compliance, and ethical integration of AI across academic and operational domains [@uwc2022].

### Guidance

Guidance will ensure thorough professional development in AI literacy aligned explicitly with UWC Costa Rica’s strategic goals [@uwc2022]. The interdisciplinary AI Committee members will first undergo extensive training in ethical and effective AI use. Subsequently, this committee will:

- Facilitate broader staff training  
- Create clear onboarding procedures for new hires  
- Conduct ongoing peer observation and co-teaching  
- Foster school-wide understanding of AI’s ethical implications [@furze2024]

### Guardrails

Guardrails will be articulated as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), ensuring ethical AI integration aligns with institutional commitments to sustainability, diversity, inclusion, academic integrity, and transparency [@uwc2022]. These SOPs will explicitly outline acceptable AI uses, proper citation practices, and protocols addressing equity, bias mitigation, and privacy.

## Potential Impacts of AI

| Priority                            | AI Support & Amplification                                                     | AI Challenges & Tensions                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sustainability**                  | Enhanced resource optimization; simulations for sustainability education [@uwc2022; @gsnn2024].| AI systems may contribute to increased energy consumption and electronic waste, potentially contradicting sustainability goals. Institutions must balance the environmental costs of AI technologies with their potential benefits. |
| **Personalized Learning**           | Customized learning pathways; personalized feedback [@uwc2024].                      | While AI enables individualized learning experiences, it may unintentionally reduce meaningful human interaction and exacerbate inequities if some students lack reliable access to necessary tools or devices.               |
| **Academic Excellence**             | Enhanced analytical capabilities; skill development [@micitt2024; @uwc2024].         | Overreliance on AI for content generation may compromise academic integrity, lead to superficial understanding, and perpetuate biases embedded in training data.                                                         |
| **Belonging & Well-being**          | Well-being monitoring; inclusivity and support [@uwc2024; @gsnn2024].                           | AI tools may raise significant concerns around student privacy and data security, and if misapplied, may reinforce exclusion through biased predictions or intrusive surveillance.                                         |
| **Global Citizenship**              | Facilitating global collaboration; intercultural understanding [@uwc2024].           | If AI systems are not culturally sensitive or inclusive in their data and outputs, they may misrepresent global perspectives and contribute to inequity rather than promoting global citizenship.                          |
