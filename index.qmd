# UWC Costa Rica AI Policy Portal

Welcome to the AI Policy hub for UWC Costa Rica. This site hosts two key documents that guide our strategic and operational approach to artificial intelligence in our educational environment.

## ðŸ“˜ 3G AI Framework Alignment 

This document was part of our AI policy design work with International School Services (ISS). It includes:

- Alignment of UWC values with the Costa Rican National AI Strategy, UWC International AI Policy, Green Schools National Network.
- Application of the 3G Framework: Governance, Guidance, and Guardrails.
- Thematic analysis of UWCâ€™s strategic priorities and how AI supports or challenges them.

## ðŸ“„ AI Policy and Guidelines

This document serves as our internal Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and outlines:

- The 5-level AI usage scale adopted from Leon Furze and collaborators.
- Department-specific guidelines for AI use across academics, HR, co-curricular, and administration.
- Implementation strategy, governance model, and oversight committee structure.
